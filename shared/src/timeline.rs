//! User-facing activity timeline with privacy-aware event filtering.
//!
//! Trellis contracts already emit rich ledger events, but ledger events are
//! written for *integrators*, not for the people whose records they describe.
//! A user asking "what happened to my record?" needs a filtered, ordered,
//! paginated view — and must never see maintainer-only operational context.
//!
//! This module provides that view.
//!
//! ## Two separate stores
//!
//! | Store              | Written by            | Read by                     |
//! |--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
//! | User timeline      | [`append_user_event`] | [`timeline_page`]           |
//! | Maintainer audit   | [`record_audit_event`]| [`audit_trail`]             |
//! | Domain action log  | [`record_action_audit_event`]| [`action_audit_trail`] |
//!
//! The stores live under different storage keys and have different accessors,
//! so a maintainer-only entry is structurally incapable of appearing in a
//! user-facing page: there is no code path from [`TimelineKey::AuditEntry`] to
//! [`timeline_page`]. [`append_user_event`] also refuses
//! [`Visibility::Maintainer`] outright, so the separation cannot be broken by
//! passing the wrong flag either.
//!
//! ## Visibility rules
//!
//! | [`Visibility`]     | Anonymous | Participant | Maintainer |
//! |--------------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
//! | `Public`           | yes       | yes         | yes        |
//! | `Participant`      | no        | yes         | yes        |
//! | `Maintainer`       | no        | no          | audit only |
//!
//! "Participant" means the viewer is the entry's `actor` or its `subject`.
//! "Maintainer" means the viewer holds [`Role::Admin`] or [`Role::Upgrader`] —
//! see [`is_maintainer`].
//!
//! ## Ordering and pagination
//!
//! Every entry gets a monotonically increasing `seq` from an append-only
//! counter. Pages are always returned in `seq` order and are addressed by the
//! `seq` of the last entry the caller saw, so:
//!
//! - redacting or deleting an entry never renumbers or reorders anything else;
//! - a page never repeats or skips an entry that was visible when the cursor
//!   was issued;
//! - concurrent appends can only extend the sequence, never shift it.
//!
//! A single request examines at most [`MAX_SCAN_PER_PAGE`] sequence numbers, so
//! a page whose visibility filter rejects most entries returns a short page
//! together with a `next_cursor` the caller can resume from. That keeps a read
//! bounded no matter how sparse the visible entries become.
